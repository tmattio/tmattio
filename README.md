### Hi there, I'm Thibaut ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for making complex stuff easy to reason about and user friendly.

I wrote code to build robots ([Sonia](http://sonia.etsmtl.ca/)); camera drivers and C++ desktop apps ([Mirametrix](https://www.mirametrix.com/)); computer vision algorithms ([Patsnap](https://www.patsnap.com/)); data ingestion pipelines and wharehouses ([Roof AI](https://roof.ai/)); NLP models and data annotation platforms ([Keatext](keatext.com)).

I love discovering new tech, and especially programming languages. My latest favorite is OCaml, but I'm missing the toolings of other ecosystems, so I'm doing my part to fill the gap ðŸ‘¾

## ðŸ’¬ Want to work with me?

I'm available for hire. If you're building products using machine learning, or if you're building a web service, I can help. Don't hesitate to reach out ðŸ˜€
