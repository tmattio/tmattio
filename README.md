### Hi there, I'm Thibaut ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for making complex stuff easy to reason about and user friendly.

I wrote code to build robots ([Sonia](http://sonia.etsmtl.ca/)); camera drivers and C++ desktop apps ([Mirametrix](https://www.mirametrix.com/)); computer vision algorithms ([Patsnap](https://www.patsnap.com/)); data ingestion pipelines and wharehouses ([Roof AI](https://roof.ai/)); NLP models and data annotation platforms ([Keatext](keatext.com)).

I love discovering new tech, and especially programming languages. My latest favorite is OCaml, but I'm missing the toolings of other ecosystems, so I'm doing my part to fill the gap ðŸ‘¾

## ðŸ‘€ What I'm working on

I'm currently building an end-to-end machine learning platfom that supports companies at every step of their workflow: data analytics, annotation, model training and model deployment. Interesting in hearing more? Do reach out!

In parallel of that, I'm doing consultancy work for web or machine learning projects, or leading development teams.

I'm also involved in open-source communities. Here are a few projects I am working on:

- [Spin](https://github.com/tmattio/spin) - OCaml project generator.
- [Opium](https://github.com/rgrinberg/opium) - OCaml web framework.

## ðŸ’¬ Want to work with me?

I'm available for hire. If you're looking for a contractor for short to medium term projects, don't hesitate to reach out ðŸ˜€
